            <h2>What is It Like Living in Nigeria?</h2>
            <p>An African country that was once dubbed 'The African Giant', although most of us are too young to know when that ever was.There are points with the highs, the lows and the in-between. Although, who is to say that many do not mainly just experience the lows?</p>
            <p>As it is usually done, we will start with the highs. The food, the numerous colourful cultures, the clothes, and so many more. These are some of the highs that abound in the once 'African Giant'.</p>

        <h1>The Cats with Twelve Lives</h1>
        <h2>Albert the Fat Cat</h2>
        <p>Albert was a happy 3 year old when he encountered The Endless, an entity cloaked in black who was known to add cat lives to only the most deserving.The Endless also took lives from the naughtiest of cats. When Albert saw it, he scurried away in fright and tried to hide in any space that might fit him, sure that his lives were to be snatched away.</p>
    <h2>Abbie the Fashionista</h2>
    <p>Abbie was always dressed in knitted caps and pink fur coats, a known fashionista in her town. It so happens that on that fateful day, she met The Endless, fully clothed in its black cloak. She scowled in distate at its fashion choice, but soon let out a loud screech when she heard the deep, unsettling voice which radiated from it.</p>
